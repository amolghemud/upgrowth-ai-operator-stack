# Competitor Teardown

## What problem this replaces
Ad-hoc competitor analysis that lives in someone's head, a stale slide deck, or a spreadsheet no one updates. Teams either obsess over competitors reactively or ignore them entirely — both lead to poor positioning and missed opportunities.

## When NOT to use this
- When you're in a brand-new category with no direct competitors
- When the decision doesn't depend on competitive positioning
- When you need real-time competitive intelligence (pricing changes, live campaigns)
- When you already have a current, structured competitive analysis from the last 30 days

## Inputs required
- Your product/service and core value proposition
- Competitor name(s) (1-5 competitors per run)
- Competitor URL(s)
- Analysis dimensions (pick from: positioning, messaging, pricing, content strategy, SEO footprint, ad strategy, product features, audience targeting)
- Your strategic question (e.g. "Where are we losing deals?" or "What positioning gap can we own?")

## Outputs expected
- Competitor profile summary (what they do, who they target, how they position)
- Dimension-by-dimension comparison matrix
- Messaging and positioning teardown (taglines, landing page structure, proof points used)
- Identified strengths to counter and weaknesses to exploit
- Content and SEO overlap analysis
- Strategic recommendations tied to your original question
- Evidence-linked findings (no unsourced claims)

## How we use this at upGrowth
We run this in three scenarios:
1. **Pre-campaign** — Before building a GTM plan, to identify positioning white space
2. **Quarterly review** — To update our competitive landscape understanding
3. **Client onboarding** — To give new clients a clear picture of where they stand

The output feeds into Campaign Planner and Content Brief Generator for execution.

## Failure modes
- Surface-level analysis that just restates what's on a homepage
- Treating competitors as static — missing recent pivots or launches
- Confirmation bias — finding only evidence that supports your existing position
- Comparing features instead of positioning and perceived value
- Missing indirect competitors or category substitutes

## Claude Co-work implementation

Recommended setup:
- Create a custom skill named "Competitor Teardown"
- Use this spec as the system instruction
- Require URL-backed evidence for every claim
- Force a "So what?" section — raw analysis without strategic implications is useless
- Output as structured comparison with clear action items

This plugin is designed to be human-governed. Competitive strategy decisions require human judgment — the teardown provides the evidence base.
