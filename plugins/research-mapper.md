# Research Mapper

## What problem this replaces
Manual market research scattered across tabs, PDFs, blog posts, and opinions, leading to shallow or biased strategy.

## When NOT to use this
- When speed matters more than accuracy
- When the decision is reversible
- When you already have validated internal data

## Inputs required
- Research question or hypothesis
- Industry or market definition
- Time horizon (e.g. last 12 months)
- Geography (if relevant)

## Outputs expected
- Structured summary of findings
- Source-linked evidence
- Clear signal vs noise separation
- Open questions and unknowns

## How we use this at UpGrowth
We run this before:
- Market entry decisions
- GTM strategy creation
- High-stakes client recommendations
- Regulatory or industry-sensitive work

The output feeds directly into synthesis and decision plugins.

## Failure modes
- Over-indexing on popular sources
- Missing contrarian or non-obvious signals
- Treating summaries as conclusions

Human judgment is mandatory after output.
